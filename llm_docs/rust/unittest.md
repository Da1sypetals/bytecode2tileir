Unit tests for tile associated methods must cover 2-d, 3-d, 4-d tiles, NOT JUST 1-d tiles.
Each dimension of tiles must have different shapes, i.e. [64, 64, 64] or  is NOT acceptable.
Tile shapes are power-of-2, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 64, 128, etc.
You are only allowed to write into 1 function each time, do not encapsulate.
